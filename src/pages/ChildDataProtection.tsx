        <h2>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          At AI-Shiksha, we take the privacy and security of children's data very seriously. This Child Data 
          Protection Policy outlines our specific practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of 
          personal information from children under the age of 13 or the applicable age in your jurisdiction.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Parental Consent</h2>
        <p>
          We require verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.

          of their child's data at any time.
